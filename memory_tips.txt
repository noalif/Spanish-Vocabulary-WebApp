Studies have found that <span style='color:blue'>a person only needs 600 words</span> to understand what is written in a daily newspaper - the 600 most useful and common words in a particular language.

-   If you enter a restaurant and ask the waiter "Queremos dos raciones de churros, por favor"
    (we want 2 portions of churros please), he will understand you even if you ask
    "dos churros" (two churros) while you mark 2 with your fingers. with a promise.
    It's that simple - to communicate effectively with the locals without complicated grammar or an impressive vocabulary. 600 words and you are set.

##### **If you learn 20 new words every day, you will be able to understand a daily newspaper in Spanish within a month without having studied grammar!**

Still, we are here to learn, speak and enjoy Spanish.

So how do you manage to remember such a large number of words?

Good question!

<u>Here are 3 recommended methods that will make the learning experience simpler:</u>

1)  **Associations!**

    Try to find one or two words that sound similar to the word you want to learn, for example:
    incendio ("fire") sounds like "in sand yo", imagine someone yelling at a friend the instructions for extinguishing a fire: in the sand! Yoo!

    Imagination and humor are significant tools for improving memory - take advantage of them and create memorable associations!

2)  **Combining words in everyday language!**

    If you want to remember that 'dinero' is 'money' you can combine the word in sentences from life:
    "I'm going to withdraw dinero from the ATM"
    "How much dinero is that?"
    In this way, our brain understands and learns the meaning of the word.

3)  **Songs my friends, songs!**

    You can take a familiar song and change some of the words in it, for example:
    "Imagine all the gente
    Livin' vida in peace"
    (people = gente, life = vida)
    Or for advanced students - put together a song with the words!

And finally - if you come across an unfamiliar word, or you just think you know it, check the dictionary and learn its meaning once and for all. There are words that we have heard hundreds of times and we still do not know their meaning for sure (even though we think otherwise).
